# Processing Sequences Using RNNs and CNNs
RNNs can analyze time series data, such as the number of daily active users on your website, 
the hourly temperature in your city, your homeâ€™s daily power consumption.

Rnn => In a recurrent neural network (RNN), the idea is that the neuron or unit doesn't just take in an input at each time step but also "remembers" its previous state. 

### Memory Cells:

Memory cells are special components in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that help the network remember information over time. They are designed to keep track of what happened in previous time steps when processing sequences (like text, time-series data, or anything that has a sequential structure).
